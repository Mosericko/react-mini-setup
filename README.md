# react-mini-setup

A small and quick react setup for my small projects

comes bundled with Material Ui dependencies

Removed all the unnecessary files that are not important for a quick setup

## Getting Started

First, clone the project to your prefered local folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mosericko/react-mini-setup.git

```

Secondly, install the dependencies through your terminal:

```bash
npm install
# or
npm i
```

## How to run setup

In your terminal run

```bash
 npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Extras

- Added material ui theme folder and connected it to index.js
- Added components section with an Iconify component that has the following advantages:
  - One syntax for over 100,000 icons from 100+ icon sets.
  - Renders SVG. Many components simply render icon fonts, which look ugly. Iconify renders pixel perfect SVG.
  - Loads icons on demand. No need to bundle icons, component will automatically load icon data for icons that you use from Iconify API.
